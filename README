Live monitor
------------

An experimental web application using websockets and smoothie graphs to do live
high-resolution monitoring. 

It does not have a cute name.

The license is 2-clause BSD. Copyright is Christian Theune.

Building
--------

* virtualenv .
* bin/python bootstrap.py
* bin/buildout

Running
-------

In one terminal connect to an haproxy that offers its statistic interface at /admin/stats:

* ssh -L 8092:localhost:8092 somehostrunninghaproxy

Then, start the server:

* bin/livemonitor

Then, connect with a Websockets-capable browser:

* http://localhost:5000

If the haproxy isn't available when starting the server, then the server will
crash partially.

Building on OS X
----------------

* brew install libevent
* CFLAGS="-I /opt/local/include" bin/buildout

Unfortunately, zc.recipe.egg's include-dirs option doesn't help. Maybe because of clang being used.
