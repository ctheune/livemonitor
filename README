Live monitor
------------

An experimental web application using websockets and smoothie graphs to do live
high-resolution monitoring. 

It does not have a cute name.

The license is 2-clause BSD. Copyright is Christian Theune.

Building on OS X
----------------

* brew install libevent
* CFLAGS="-I /opt/local/include" bin/buildout

Unfortunately, zc.recipe.egg's include-dirs option doesn't help. Maybe because of clang being used.
